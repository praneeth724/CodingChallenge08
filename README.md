 💻 Excited to share another coding challenge with you all. This time, we're diving into the world of game development with Unity! 🕹️

Challenge Overview: 🌟

Our game consists of two main components - the player and the power-up system. When the player successfully collects a power-up, magic happens! ✨


1️⃣ Destroying Power-Ups:

  - When the player collects a power-up, it disappears. Can you make it happen in your Unity project?

2️⃣ Speed Boost:

  - Here's the twist! Upon collecting a power-up, the player's speed increases for a short duration. Can you implement this temporary speed boost?

3️⃣ Back to Normal:

  - The speed boost is not permanent. After a brief moment of glory, the player's speed should return to its initial value. Can you manage this transition smoothly?
